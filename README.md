### Rules on commit messages' content

1. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
    * Please make an extra effort to explain why changes are needed for every non-trivial
      modification.
2. If your pull request solves problem from the issues, please leave a link to it in the body of the
   pull request
3. If possible, try to avoid commits like *"Fixed after check "* and replace them with meaningful
   ones.
4. Keep the subject (the first line of the commit message) clean and readable. All additional
   information and directives for external tools
   should be moved to the body of the message.

### Rules on commit messages' style/formatting

1. Before the subject line, add a symbol to show what your commit contains

* [+] - Addition
* [-] - Delete
* [~] - Fix, edit

2. Separate subject from body with a blank line
3. Do not capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
